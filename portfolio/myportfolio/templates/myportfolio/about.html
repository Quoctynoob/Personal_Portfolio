<h1 class="text-center">About me</h1>

<p>
    I'm a computer science student at the University of Guelph with a strong passion for full-stack 
    development, particularly enjoying back-end work. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid 
    foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. I've worked on several 
    projects, including developing web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and HTML/CSS. 
    Currently, Iâ€™m working on an exciting game project using Java, which has allowed me to deepen my 
    understanding of object-oriented programming and game design.
    Outside of academics and coding, I'm an avid tennis player and enjoy other racket sports as well, which 
    keep me active and disciplined. I also love watching anime, which has sparked my interest in Japanese 
    culture and led me to start learning the language.
    I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity 
    that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
